  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve always been curious — the kind of person who would read articles, dive into facts, and explore ideas online just to learn something new. That daily habit of curiosity turned into a passion for understanding how things work — especially in the worlds of business and people.
  </p>
  <p>
    I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Commerce, where I found myself drawn to subjects like economics and management. During college, I worked part-time as a marketing intern for a café. I got to set up food delivery channels, design pamphlets, and create social media posts — all with the basics I picked up in Canva. It was simple work, but I loved how creativity met business.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then came my experience at <strong>Coding Superstar</strong>, where I started building sales reports and working on customer acquisition — and that’s where my love for digital marketing was born. Later at <strong>Tamara Leisure</strong>, I moved into performance marketing and analytics. That experience sparked my desire to dig deeper into numbers and patterns — and led me to pursue my Master's in Business Analytics at ASU.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether it was the creative spark at Coding Superstar or the analytical curiosity at Tamara, I’ve always followed the fuel that keeps me learning. Today, I’m blending creativity and analytics to tell better stories with data — and constantly growing along the way.
