        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I’ve always been curious — the kind of person who would read articles, dive into facts, and explore ideas online just to learn something new. That daily habit of curiosity turned into a passion for understanding how things work — especially in the worlds of business and people.</p>

        <p>I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Commerce, where I found myself drawn to subjects like economics and management. During college, I worked part-time as a marketing intern for a café. I got to set up food delivery channels, design pamphlets, and create social media posts — all with the basics I picked up in Canva. It was simple work, but I loved how creativity met business. Then came my experience at Coding Superstar, where I started building sales reports and working on customer acquisition — and that’s where my love for digital marketing was born. Later at Tamara, I moved into performance marketing and analytics. That experience sparked my desire to dig deeper into numbers and patterns — and led me to pursue my Master's in Business Analytics at ASU.</p>

        <p>Whether it was the creative spark at Coding Superstar or the analytical curiosity at Tamara, I’ve always followed the fuel that keeps me learning. Today, I’m blending creativity and analytics to tell better stories with data — and constantly growing along the way.</p>

  <h2>Academic Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Studying Business Analytics at W. P. Carey has been a hands-on, eye-opening experience. I still remember using Python for the first time to predict coffee ratings — and presenting the results with business insights in front of a live audience. That moment sparked something.
  </p>
  <p>
    From there, every project brought something new: analyzing solar power data taught me how models can improve energy efficiency; designing experiments with a LEGO car helped me understand how small variables impact outcomes; optimizing business processes challenged me to think structurally. One of the most exciting projects was building a facial recognition-based study room system — it was real, technical, and collaborative.
  </p>
  <p>
    Restaurant closure prediction was tough — combining sentiment analysis, LSTM, and unstructured data — but we figured it out as a team. I also got to explore the creative side of analytics through a digital marketing campaign pitch for Plantennas, where we designed a go-to-market plan for a plant sensor startup. Another highlight was conducting customer research for music streaming platforms — diving deep into user behavior, motivations, and preferences to inform product strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s the theme, really: most of these projects were built with amazing teammates, and every one of them taught me something new — not just about data, but about people, behavior, and how to turn insight into action.
