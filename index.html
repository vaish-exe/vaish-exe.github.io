        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™ve always been curious â€” the kind of person who would read articles, dive into facts, and explore ideas online just to learn something new. That daily habit of curiosity turned into a passion for understanding how things work â€” especially in the worlds of business and people.</p>

        <p>I pursued a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Commerce, where I found myself drawn to subjects like economics and management. During college, I worked part-time as a marketing intern for a cafÃ©. I got to set up food delivery channels, design pamphlets, and create social media posts â€” all with the basics I picked up in Canva. It was simple work, but I loved how creativity met business.</p>

        <p>Then came my experience at <strong>Coding Superstar</strong>, where I started building sales reports and working on customer acquisition â€” and thatâ€™s where my love for digital marketing was born. Later at <strong>Tamara Leisure</strong>, I moved into performance marketing and analytics. That experience sparked my desire to dig deeper into numbers and patterns â€” and led me to pursue my Master's in Business Analytics at ASU.</p>

        <p>Whether it was the creative spark at Coding Superstar or the analytical curiosity at Tamara, Iâ€™ve always followed the fuel that keeps me learning. Today, Iâ€™m blending creativity and analytics to tell better stories with data â€” and constantly growing along the way.</p>
